### Joandre Olmeda is a questionable person
This mod aims to add several things that Joandre Olmeda is well known for, which includes:
- Yogurt
- Blueberries
- Dropping phones into toilets
- Terrible music
As well as other items that one may find interesting

Many items are made with a new ore called "Joandreite", a light blue semi-rare crystal
Strawberries, blueberries, and vanilla are all new plants that can be found where you would think they would

Strawberries: Birch biomes
Blueberries: Forest and plains biomes
Vanilla: Jungle biomes

Some items added have new behaviors that will, with a 100% guarantee, make you question why they haven't already been added to Minecraft! A key behavior is turning Zoglins, a famously useless and stupid mob, into Hoglins!

Compatibility with other mods is very likely, but the mods this one has been tested with are REI and Sodium

This mod is still a work-in-progress and new features will be added to integrate more Joandrefeatures into the game
